# Anomaly Detection for Observability using Isolation Forest

# Overview

This project implements anomaly detection for observability data using the Isolation Forest algorithm. The model identifies anomalous patterns in system metrics and logs to detect potential issues such as high CPU consumption, memory leaks, and network anomalies.

# Features

Uses Isolation Forest for unsupervised anomaly detection.

Detects anomalies in observability data (CPU, RAM, network usage, etc.).


# Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

Redis (for storing anomaly metrics and logs)
